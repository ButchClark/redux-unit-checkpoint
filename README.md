# ðŸš¦ Checkpoint

Convert Reddit...ish to React with Redux!

## Getting started

* Go to the follwing repository and clone [this project](https://github.com/gSchool/reddit-clone-redux) to your local machine
* Install the dependencies with either `yarn` or `npm install`
* This is styled with `Bootstrap v3.3.7`

Just like the previous checkpoints, you will be hitting the [provided API for this course](https://github.com/gSchool/collective-api) and be hitting the following endpoints:

* `http://localhost:8000/posts` (for the posts)
* `http://localhost:8000/comments` (for the comments)

You could roughly follow these steps (not necessarily in this order):

* Use yarn to add `redux react-redux redux-thunk`
* Create a reducer for each "resource", such as posts and comments, in this case
* Configure a store with `redux-thunk` and the reducers
* Create an actions / action-creators file for each "resource"
* Figure out which components should be connected components and implement `mapStateToProps` / `mapDispatchToProps` where necessary
